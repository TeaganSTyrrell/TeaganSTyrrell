## Hi there :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
*My name is Teagan Tyrrell! Below is a bit about me :relaxed:*

## Year: 4

## Major: Neuroscience 🧠

- ⚡ Fun fact: I enrolled in <mark>Neural Data Science</mark> because I believe coding is an essential skill for future careers in neuroscience, particularly those involving medical imaging technologies. As someone with no prior experience, I saw this course as a good introduction to coding in a way that is directly applied to neuroscience.
- 🥼 How I got into studying neuroscience: I took a first-year psychology course as an elective and really enjoyed the unit on the brain. I also completed an introductory Health and Disease course, where I designed an experimental study focused on traumatic brain injuries. Both experiences sparked my interest and motivated me to pursue neuroscience.
- 👩‍🎓 Future career aspirations: After I graduate, I plan to pursue graduate studies in neuroscience to deepen my understanding of the field, with the potential goal of attending medical school afterwards to apply this knowledge in a clinical setting.
